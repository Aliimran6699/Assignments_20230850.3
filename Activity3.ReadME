This Python script generates combinations of cars and colors by iterating through each car in the "cars" list and pairing it with every color in the "colors" list. 
It uses nested for loops to achieve this, printing each combination as it goes. 
The output consists of all possible combinations of cars and colors, creating a comprehensive list of potential car-color combinations.
