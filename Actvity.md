This Python program, Grade Classifier, is a simple tool designed to classify numerical scores into corresponding grades. Upon execution, it prompts the user to input a score within the range of 0 to 100. The program then validates the input to ensure it falls within this range. If the input is valid, the program determines the grade based on predefined criteria:

A grade is assigned for scores of 80 and above.
B grade is assigned for scores between 60 and 79.
Pass is assigned for scores between 50 and 59.
Fail is assigned for scores below 50.
The program provides immediate feedback, indicating whether the input score is valid or not, and if valid, the determined grade is displayed. It's essential to note that scores outside the range of 0 to 100 will result in an error message indicating an invalid score.

Usage:
Run the program.
Enter the score when prompted.
The program will output the corresponding grade based on the input score.
